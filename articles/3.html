        <p>What is possible and what is not possible is not my business. <br>
        My business is to strive and work for what matters to me.</p>
        <p>Time, situation, luck is not in my control. <br>
        I have control over my work and effort. That's it.</p>
        <p>I have to do whatever it takes to create what I want. <br>
        If my goals requires less work to accomplish it. I have to do less. <br> If my goals requires more work to accomplish it. I have to do more.</p>
        <p>I have to keep my focus and energy unwavering.
        Cut all the factors that is distracting me from achieving what I want. Create a situation where I can not be distracted
        even if I want to.</p>
        <p>For me it was all types of media ( images, videos, games, movies ). They were constantly deviating my energy and focus.
        Then I created a system to avoid these things.
        
        Now nothing is distracting me. Here and there I consume media but that is not a big deal.</p>
        <p>I force myself to work even if I didn't feel to work. Because if that is what it takes to achieve my goals, then I have to
        do it. If I can't do what it takes,
        then I can not create what I want.</p>
        <p class="lastline">SHUT UP AND WORK. <br>
        EVERYTHING ELSE IS DISTRACTION.</p>
